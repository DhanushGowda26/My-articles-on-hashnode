```bash
git init
```

The `git init` command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. It creates a hidden `.git` folder that stores the version control metadata for tracking changes, enabling you to start managing your project's history. Running this command is typically the first step when setting up a new project for version control.

**Configuring Git Username and Email**  
Git requires a username and email address to associate with your commits. You can set these globally (for all repositories) or locally (for a specific repository).

### Global Configuration

To set your username and email globally:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### Local Configuration

To set your username and email for a specific repository:

```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

To check the current configuration:

```bash
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

### `git add`

The `git add` command stages changes (new, modified, or deleted files) to the Git index, preparing them for the next commit. It doesn't save changes to the repository but marks them for inclusion in the next commit.

#### Examples:

* Stage a specific file:
    
    ```bash
    git add file.txt
    ```
    
* Stage multiple files:
    
    ```bash
    git add file1.txt file2.txt
    ```
    
* Stage all changes in the current directory:
    
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

### `git commit`

The `git commit` command saves the staged changes to the repository's history. It creates a snapshot of the current state of your project and requires a commit message to describe the changes.

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

Commit is nothing but version

Lets say on version 1 itself I need to add another file but by mistake I did not, so instead of creating a new commit i can able to add in previous commit itself. To amend the last commit (modify message or include more changes):

```bash
git commit --amend
```

use git log to check how many commit/version you have of your project/

* If you accidentally stage a file:
    
    ```bash
    git reset file.txt
    ```
    
    From staging area it comes to working area
    
* Reset to a specific commit:
    
    ```bash
    git reset <version1-commit-hash>
    ```
    
    The changes introduced by `version2` are **moved from the commit history back to the working directory** (unstaged).
    
* Discard all changes and reset the working directory to match the specified commit. here, in working area also you wont have your work
    
    ```bash
    git reset --hard <version1-commit-hash>
    ```
    
    ### **Git Checkout Example Workflow**
    
    1. Start with a committed file:
        
        ```bash
        echo "original content" > file.txt
        git add file.txt
        git commit -m "Add file.txt"
        ```
        
    2. Modify the file:
        
        ```bash
        echo "new content" >> file.txt
        ```
        
    3. Use `git checkout -- file.txt`:
        
        ```bash
        git checkout -- file.txt
        ```
        
    4. Result:
        
        * The file is restored to its original content as committed.
            
        * Any changes made to the file after the last commit are discarded.

        ### To revert the file to the last committed state, you can do one of the following:
        
        1. **Unstage the file (if staged):**
            
            * First, you need to **unstage** the file using:
                
                ```bash
                git reset hi.txt
                ```
                
                This will remove the file from the staging area and leave it in the working directory with the changes.
                
        2. **Discard the changes after unstaging:**
            
            * Now that the file is in the working directory, you can use:
                
                ```bash
                git checkout -- hi.txt
                ```
                
                This will revert `hi.txt` to its state from the last commit.
                
                * `git checkout -- <file>` only works to discard changes in the working directory if the file is modified **but not staged**.
                    
                * If the file is staged, you need to unstage it first using `git reset <file>`, then you can use `git checkout -- <file>` to revert the file to the last committed state.
                    
                
                ```bash
                git checkout <version2-commit-hash>
                ```
                
                This way you can switch to any version, and you will be on that particular version above versions you wont have. now you wont be having version3,4,5 anything above version2 because version3,4,5,etc are not a part of version2
                
                ```bash
                git checkout <version1-commit-hash> index.html/folder
                ```
                
                Lets say we are on version7 and in version7 we need version1 contents(index.html), so by above command in version7 only index.html will be from of version1.
